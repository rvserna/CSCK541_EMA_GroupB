# CSCK541_EMA_GroupB

# Summary

This repository includes a simple client/server network in which the client will send a serialized dictionary, text file, and message to the server. The data is encrypted by the client and sent to the server, where it is then decrypted. The server has a configurable option to print the received items to the screen and/or a file.

# Instructions
```
Run the server file with print commend first:
To run the commend to print on screen, please run python server.py --print-to-screen
To run the commend to print to file, please run python server.py --print-to-file

Then run the client file:
python3 client.py

Please check the version of python which you are using. 
It may affect the commend using whether python or python3.
```
