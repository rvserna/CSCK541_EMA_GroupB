# Summary

This repository includes a simple client/server network in which the client will send a serialized dictionary, text file, and message to the server. The data is encrypted by the client and sent to the server, where it is then decrypted. The server has a configurable option to print the received items to the screen and/or a file.

# Instructions

Run the server file first:
python3 server.py
